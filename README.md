The game has been designed based on the popular game _CLASH OF CLANS_. The main idea is the creation of a war game of strategy.

The game consists in the selection of 'troops' by means of the keyboard, and in their deployment by means of the use of the left click of the mouse along the
map available, within limits.

These troops will move and fire at the nearest enemy (hereinafter 'defense'), creating random shots based on a randomly created number,
contained within limits.

The defenses, on the other hand, are fixed and invariant, but they also look for objects to shoot, creating the random shot in the direction of their 'enemy'.
Whoever destroys all the enemy's objects first wins the level, and whoever passes all 4 levels wins the game.
There are different troops, as will be seen later, characterized by their speed, damage and range. These values will vary as the
level. The number of defenses and the available number of troops will also increase.

By way of explanation, a file is left in which the hierarchy of classes and inheritances can be seen, by means of a keyboard shortcut, by pressing
the `*` key during the home screen.
